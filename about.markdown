### Nine Morch
#### Mechanical Engineer

My name is Nine Morch. I graduated MIT with a bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in theatre arts. Currently, I'm working as a mechanical engineer and pursuing various side projects. 

#### Areas of interest
In Mechanical Engineering, I'm interested in rapid prototyping, especially 3D printing. I'm also interested in projects for sustainable energy. 
Combining my Mech-E and Theatre studies, I am interested in set design and practical effects, as well as animatronics. 

Outside of work, I volunteer my time to the <a href="spinning-arts@mit.edu" >MIT Spinning Arts Club</a>, where I serve as an associate trainer.
