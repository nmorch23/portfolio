<a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/">FIRST Robotics</a> is an international grade school-level robotics competition, where students work in teams to build robots to compete 2v2 in a series of games. I participated from age 6 to 18 on a variety of teams. 

In 2015, I was a founding member of the team <a href="https://greengriffins.radrobotics.org/">Green.Griffins; 10092</a>, a community FIRST Tech Challenge team for students in grades 8-12.

When I was mechanical lead in the 2016-2017 school year, we built a robot (nicknamed "Slug") which got our team to the Worlds level competition and, while there, entered the game semifinals and placed in both design awards.
