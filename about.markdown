### Nine Morch
#### Mechanical Engineering senior at MIT

My name is Nine Morch. I am currently pursuing a bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering (course 2) at MIT. Additionally, I am pursuing a theatre arts minor (course 21M-2). 

#### Areas of interest
In Mechanical Engineering, I'm interested in rapid prototyping, especially 3D printing. I'm also interested in projects for sustainable energy. 
Combining my Mech-E and Theatre studies, I am interested in set design and practical effects, as well as animatronics. 

Outside of my studies and work, I dedicate my time to the <a href="spinning-arts@mit.edu" >MIT Spinning Arts Club</a>, of which I am currently president, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/mitcentrifugues">MIT Centrifugues</a>, of which I am currently co-music director.
