The class 2.008: Design and Manufacturing II requires students to spend a semester designing and then manufacturing 50 identical yo-yos. The class taught manufacturing techniques including CNC milling, thermoforming and injection molding. 

While working on the design of the yo-yo, I drew the images which were printed onto the thermoformed plastics or transformed into the 3D textures in the injection molded parts.

Our team imported my grayscale designs into blender, then mapped the values into height values to alter the shape of the 3D object.

The sun background image was printed onto a clear sheet of plastic, then thermoformed. For the ink to not crack while the plastic is stretching, it first needs to be coated with a setting spray.

After completing the requisite 50 yoyos, our team joined the manufacturing challenge and completed another 59 more in the span of nine total hours.
